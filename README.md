```

## TODO
1. Change the variable in the first part from x to t and replace dx with dt.

2. Highlight the lower triangle instead of the higher one.

3. Write the units in normal font.

4. Use curved brackets instead of angular ones. \left (...  \right ). See, e.g., http://www.malinc.se/math/latex/basiccodeen.php for reference.

5. Use \times as a multiplication sign

6. Add the missing negative exponent to ms.

7. Typeset multiplication of numbers with symbols. E.g. \frac{9.81\times 6^2}{2}.

8. Round results to the correct number of significant figures.
